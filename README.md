### Bias in ChatGPT’s Educational Responses: A Data-Driven Visualization
## Abstract
This project analyzes biases in academic responses generated by ChatGPT, aiming to uncover hidden trends in AI’s educational outputs. It collects and categorizes biases—such as subjective, cultural, gender, and language bias—from ChatGPT’s responses to various educational prompts. The results are visualized using Tableau to highlight these patterns. The project offers insights and recommendations to reduce biases, promoting fairness, accuracy, and objectivity in AI-powered educational tools.
